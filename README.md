**Summary**

In both directing and fostering the natural ability of stem cells to self-organize, significant advances have been made in the generation of functional human intestinal organoids. However, conventional methods for their generation are solely biological, when indeed intestinal development and morphogenesis are impacted by dynamic mechanical forces. As our understanding of these mechanical forces during development deepens, we are presented with the opportunity to include them in our tissue engineering strategies. Here we have taken an interdisciplinary approach to the generation of intestinal tissue and incorporated uniaxial strain serving to induce growth and maturation of the tissue. Using a variety of outcome measures including morphometric quantification, transcriptome profiling, and functional assays, we found the newly generated tissue to be more similar to native human intestine after strain exposure. The size and complexity of the tissue was significantly improved as was muscle tone. This novel methodology incorporates a developmentally relevant mechanical cue in the development of human intestinal tissue and results in enhanced maturation and enterogenesis.
